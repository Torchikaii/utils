### Utilities that I use

- `/BOM-reconstructor` used for modifying (adding/removing columns) BOM.xlsx files,
that were exported from Altium designer with their default configuration (Altium
allows you to select how many columns to export -> `BOM.xlsx`).

- `/cd-NAS` when command `repos` entered in cmd, it auto logs in to NAS (net use) and
cd's (changes directory) to `nas2\Server\Dokumentai\Aplankas\Repos`.

- `/context-engineering` context engineering files. agent's commands and PRD, PRP
files.
