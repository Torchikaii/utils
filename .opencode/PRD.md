# Product Requirements Document: Utils Monorepo

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-25

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This repository serves as a personal utility toolkit ("utils"), consolidating small but essential scripts and configurations that support daily development workflows. Rather than maintaining numerous separate repositories for small utilities, this monorepo approach keeps related tools organized, version-controlled, and easily deployable across systems.

The project addresses the practical reality that developers accumulate small scripts, configurations, and tools over time. By centralizing these utilities, the repository enables quick environment reconstruction, workflow automation, and knowledge preservation.

**Core Value Proposition:** One repository to rule all personal utilities — portable, maintainable, and ready to deploy anywhere.

**MVP Goal:** Provide a curated collection of utilities that reduce friction in daily development tasks, from workstation setup to BOM management to structured AI-assisted development.

## 2. Mission & Principles

### Mission Statement

Build and maintain a personal utility ecosystem that eliminates repetitive tasks, preserves institutional knowledge, and enables instant environment recreation across machines.

### Core Principles

1. **Simplicity First** — Each utility should do one thing well. Avoid over-engineering small tools.
2. **Portability** — Utilities must work across different environments (Linux, Windows via scripts, etc.)
3. **Idempotency** — Scripts must be safe to re-run. No duplicate entries, no errors on re-execution.
4. **Self-Contained** — Minimal external dependencies. Prefer standard library tools where possible.
5. **Documentation by Default** — Every utility includes README explaining purpose, usage, and dependencies.

## 5. User Stories

### Ubuntu Setup

**US-001:** As a developer, I want to run one script to set up a fresh Ubuntu machine, so I can be productive within minutes instead of hours of manual configuration.

**US-002:** As a developer, I want my dotfiles symlinked from a repository, so changes to configuration are automatically shared across machines.

**US-003:** As a developer, I want keyboard shortcuts configured automatically, so I don't have to reconfigure after each Ubuntu reinstall.

**US-004:** As a developer, I want to mount NAS storage with a single command, so I can access my files without manual network configuration.

### BOM Processing

**US-005:** As an electronics engineer, I want to modify BOM columns from Altium exports, so I can prepare files for different manufacturing requirements.

**US-006:** As an electronics engineer, I want to consolidate multiple BOM files, so I can compare revisions or merge component lists.

### Development Workflow

**US-007:** As an AI-augmented developer, I want structured planning commands, so I can break complex features into manageable phases.

**US-008:** As an AI-augmented developer, I want progress tracking, so I can see what remains in each development phase.

### Cross-Platform

**US-009:** As a developer using both Windows and Linux, I want platform-specific utilities in one repo, so I don't forget where my tools are located.

### Design Patterns

| Pattern | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Facade** | `main.sh` orchestrates all sub-scripts |
| **Single Responsibility** | Each `.sh` file handles one app/service |
| **Template Method** | Context engineering commands follow consistent structure |
| **Idempotent Scripts** | All scripts check state before modifying |

| Git | SSH keys / credential helpers |
| General | No sensitive data in repo |

### Configuration Management

- **Symlinks** created to `~/.config`
- **No hardcoded paths** — uses `~/repos/utils` convention

### Security Scope

- No production secrets stored
- No API keys or tokens in repository
- `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- Credentials handled by system keyring (future enhancement)

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Path dependencies** — Scripts assume `~/repos/utils` | Medium | High | Document path requirement; add path detection |
| **Ubuntu version drift** — APIs change between releases | Medium | Medium | Test on LTS releases; use version checks |
| **BOM format changes** — Altium export format varies | Low | Medium | Add format detection; version comments |
| **Context engineering template bloat** — Over-engineering | Low | Medium | Keep templates minimal; iterate based on need |
| **Windows script neglect** — Scripts not tested regularly | Low | High | Add periodic testing; document requirements |

---

## 13. Future Considerations

### Post-MVP Enhancements

- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) support** — Unified scripts across Windows/Linux
- **Homebrew/Linuxbrew compatibility** — Package management abstraction
- **Docker containerization** — Portable development environments
- **Ansible/Terraform integration** — Infrastructure-as-code for workstation
- **Dotfiles manager integration** — Consider chezmoi or GNU Stow

### Integration Opportunities

- **GitHub Codespaces** — Cloud development environment
- **VS Code Remote** — Remote development support
- **Tailscale/Headscale** — Secure remote access to NAS

### Long-Term Vision

When any single utility outgrows the monorepo, it can be extracted into its own repository while maintaining the development workflow established here. The context-engineering system is designed to be portable — copy `.opencode/` to any project for consistent AI-assisted development.
